# RequireJS module plugin #
This plugin can load RequireJS modules which can meant to be extended, overridden or replaced in another place of your application structure, so you can write a module which provides the basic functionality, but can be overriden in order to keep have a code base shared between multiple applications, and still have the ability to extend, override and replace, without rewriting the module.

## Usage
Comming later, when the plugin is more functional, and everything about has been thought through.
